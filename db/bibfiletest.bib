abstract = {Several biotechnologically important enzymes catalyze reactions by the Ping Pong bi bi mechanism. Traditional kinetic equations for these enzymes contain several terms with combinations of three or four lumped parameters, making it difficult to relate the terms directly to the reaction mechanism. Further, the Ping Pong bi bi reaction mechanism is symmetrical in the forward and reverse directions, but the traditional equations are not mathematically symmetrical. In the present work, we express the Ping Pong bi bi kinetic equation in terms of specificity constants. Our equation is consistent with the traditional equations, but has several conceptual advantages. First, the terms of our equation contain two parameters at most, making it easier to relate the terms to specific features of the reaction mechanism. Second, our equation has only eight lumped parameters, so it has no redundant parameters; traditional equations have nine lumped parameters, such that one is redundant. Third, our equation is mathematically symmetrical, explicitly reflecting the symmetry of the Ping Pong bi bi reaction mechanism. We demonstrate how the parameters of our new equation can be estimated in classic initial rate experiments.},

@article{Raza2001,
abstract = {A major problem in predicting the enantioselectivity of an enzyme toward substrate molecules is that even high selectivity toward one substrate enantiomer over the other corresponds to a very small difference in free energy. However, total free energies in enzyme-substrate systems are very large and fluctuate significantly because of general protein motion. Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB), a serine hydrolase, displays enantioselectivity toward secondary alcohols. Here, we present a modeling study where the aim has been to develop a molecular dynamics-based methodology for the prediction of enantioselectivity in CALB. The substrates modeled (seven in total) were 3-methyl-2-butanol with various aliphatic carboxylic acids and also 2-butanol, as well as 3,3-dimethyl-2-butanol with octanoic acid. The tetrahedral reaction intermediate was used as a model of the transition state. Investigative analyses were performed on ensembles of nonminimized structures and focused on the potential energies of a number of subsets within the modeled systems to determine which specific regions are important for the prediction of enantioselectivity. One category of subset was based on atoms that make up the core structural elements of the transition state. We considered that a more favorable energetic conformation of such a subset should relate to a greater likelihood for catalysis to occur, thus reflecting higher selectivity. The results of this study conveyed that the use of this type of subset was viable for the analysis of structural ensembles and yielded good predictions of enantioselectivity.},

abstract = {Lipase-catalyzed synthesis reactions must be performed in nonaqueous media (organic solvents or solvent-free systems). The choice of the optimal solvent is usually a fastidious task that necessitates the determination of kinetic parameters in each solvent. The approach used here, to overcome the lack of a model that can predict the kinetics whatever the solvent, consists in the use of thermodynamic activities instead of concentrations of components, and assumes that activity-based kinetic parameters are the same in all solvents. This assumption is discussed, and a solution is proposed which takes into account some observed residual solvent effects. The reaction chosen to test this approach was the esterification of oleic acid with ethanol catalyzed by an immobilized lipase, Lipozyme. For this reaction, the kinetics predicted in various organic solvents and in solvent-free systems is in agreement with the experimental data.},

@article{Malcata1993,
abstract = {A lipase from Aspergillus niger, immobilized by physical adsorption on hydrophobic hollow fibers made of microporous polypropylene, was used to effect the hydrolysis of the glycerides of melted butterfat at 40, 50, 55, and 60°C (pH 7.0), and at pH 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 7.0, 8.0, and 9.0 (40°C). McIlvane buffer and melted butterfat were pumped cocurrently through the hollow fiber reactor. The concentrations of ten different free fatty acids in the effluent oil stream were measured by HPLC. Multiresponse nonlinear regression methods were employed to fit the data to multisubstrate rate expressions derived from a Ping Pong Bi Bi mechanism in which the rate controlling step is deacylation of the enzyme. Thermal deactivation of the immobilized lipase was also included in the mathematical model of reactor performance. A postulated normal distribution of vmax with respect to the number of carbon atoms of the fatty acid residue (with an additive correction for the number of double bonds) was found to provide the best statistical fit of the data. The models developed can be used to independently predict the effects of either the pH or the temperature, as well as the reactor space time and the time elapsed after immobilization, on the free fatty acid profile of the lipolyzed butteroil product. {\textcopyright} 1993 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.},
