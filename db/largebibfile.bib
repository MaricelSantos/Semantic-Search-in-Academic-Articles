abstract = {Lipases (E.C. 3.1.1.3) are ubiquitous hydrolases for the carboxyl ester bond of water-insoluble substrates such as triacylglycerols and phospholipids. Candida antarctica Lipase B (CALB) acts in aqueous as well as in low-water media, thus being of considerable biochemical significance with high interest also for its industrial applications. The hydrolysis reaction follows a two-step mechanism, or ‘interfacial activation', with adsorption of the enzyme to a heterogeneous interface and subsequent enhancement of the lipolytic activity. Once positioned within the catalytic triad, substrates are then hydrolysed, and products released. However, the intermediate steps of substrate transfer from the lipidic-aqueous phase to the enzyme surface and then down to the catalytic site are still unclear. By inhibiting CALB with ethyl phosphonate and incubating with glyceryl tributyrate (2,3-di(butanoyloxy)propyl butanoate), the crystal structure of the lipid-enzyme complex, at 1.55 {\AA} resolution, shows the tributyrin in the limbus region of active site. The substrate is found 10 {\AA} above the catalytic Ser, with the glycerol backbone pre-aligned for further processing by key interactions via an extended water network with $\alpha$-helix10 and $\alpha$-helix5. The findings offer new elements to elucidate the mechanism of substrate recognition, transfer and catalysis of Candida antarctica Lipase B (CALB) and lipases in general.},

abstract = {Novozym 435 (N435) is a commercially available immobilized lipase produced by Novozymes. It is based on immobilization via interfacial activation of lipase B from Candida antarctica on a resin, Lewatit VP OC 1600. This resin is a macroporous support formed by poly(methyl methacrylate) crosslinked with divinylbenzene. N435 is perhaps the most widely used commercial biocatalyst in both academy and industry. Here, we review some of the success stories of N435 (in chemistry, energy and lipid manipulation), but we focus on some of the problems that the use of this biocatalyst may generate. Some of these problems are just based on the mechanism of immobilization (interfacial activation) that may facilitate enzyme desorption under certain conditions. Other problems are specific to the support: Mechanical fragility, moderate hydrophilicity that permits the accumulation of hydrophilic compounds (e.g., water or glycerin) and the most critical one, support dissolution in some organic media. Finally, some solutions (N435 coating with silicone, enzyme physical or chemical crosslinking, and use of alternative supports) are proposed. However, the N435 history, even with these problems, may continue in the coming future due to its very good properties if some simpler alternative biocatalysts are not developed.},

abstract = {The market is overflooded by unrefined glycerol with the production of biodiesel from vegetable oils. A recurrently studied alternative for its valorization is the production of acetins via esterification with acetic acid over acid catalysts in liquid phase. However, most of the published literature uses experimental methodologies that prevent a proper kinetic analysis of the reaction. This work revisits glycerol esterification with acetic acid catalyzed by Amberlyst-35 applying sequential statistically designed experiments. Following such approach, statistically meaningful data were collected providing insight into the catalytic reaction. Experiments were designed to test the influence of the quantity of active sites; assumed herein as the number of surface SO3H+ sites on Amberlyst-35, temperature, and the acetic acid to glycerol molar ratio over the turnover frequency of the catalyst. The collected evidence shows that, under the typical conditions employed in most open literature, heat and mass transport artifacts should not be neglected. In the present case, these limitations were overcome by reducing the particle size of the solid. Under such conditions, a straightforward relationship between the concentration of surface SO3H+ active sites and the glycerol turnover rates was established. Meanwhile, it was shown that the reaction temperature has a rather weak effect on the catalytic turnover. This trend concurred with the thermodynamic equilibrium of the reaction. Likewise, the already established effect of the acetic acid to glycerol molar ratio was also confirmed. Overall, the performed study serves a double purpose. First, it is a methodological guide to collect kinetically relevant information in liquid phase. Second, it reports intrinsic kinetic rates for the esterification reaction over the studied catalyst hence paving the way for a rigorous kinetic modeling.},

abstract = {This work was set to exergoeconomically and exergoenvironmentally scrutinize and optimize oxygenated fuel additives (acetins) synthesis from biodiesel-derived glycerol via esterification with acetic acid. To this end, an easy-to-scale up continuous process was developed to assess the effects of process temperature (T), feed volume flow rate (F), acetic acid/glycerin molar ratio (X), and process pressure (P) on exergetic parameters. After developing exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental balance equations for the process, the variations of parameters of both approaches were comprehensively investigated and discussed as a function of the process variables. The optimum process variables were also explored using response surface method (RSM). Two key exergetic indicators viz. unit exergoeconomic cost and exergoenvironmental impact of the product were modeled and minimized using the RSM. The developed RSM models successfully predicted both objective functions with an R2 close to 1. The optimum process variables were: T = 134.4 °C, F = 0.6 mL/min, X = 2, and P = 125.6 bar. The cost per unit exergy (unit exergoeconomic cost) and environmental impact per unit exergy (exergoenvironmental impact) of the product under these conditions were determined at 158.2 $/GJ and 200.8 mPts/GJ, respectively. Generally, the use of exergetic indicators was found to help decision makers to weigh and improve the efficiency, productivity, and sustainability of complex chemical processes such as oxygenated fuel additives synthesis. Moreover, the developed frameworks herein could be easily extended and implemented to a wide variety of chemical processes producing fuel additives in order to explore their most exergetically, financially, and ecologically appealing configurations and process variables.},

abstract = {An overview is provided of commercially-available biolubricants, along with the manufacturing technologies used to make them, and emerging production technologies that show promise. Ester-based biolubricants enjoy the most widespread commercial use, even though complex chemical modifications are required to improve their physicochemical properties. Renewable-hydrocarbon biolubricants can be more attractive because they possess desirable qualities such as superior cold-flow properties and oxidative and hydrolytic stability. In addition, hydrocarbon-based biolubricants are more similar to conventional lubricants and can be easily substituted using existing infrastructure and lubricant formulations. Current research on renewable hydrocarbons is heavily focused on hydrodeoxygenation of vegetable oils involving operating conditions in excess of 50 bar and 450 °C. Alternative routes such as those involving electrochemical decarboxylation through Kolbe electrolysis benefit from milder conditions and consume less hydrogen overall. A further benefit of Kolbe electrolysis is the potential for integration into renewable energy systems. Further research into this technology could open the doors to low-cost, high-quality renewable hydrocarbons for use as biolubricants.},

abstract = {Esterification reaction between formic acid and alcohols (C4, C8) catalyzed by lipases was performed in solvent and solvent-free systems. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) was used to study the kinetic parameters (Michaelis-Menten) and the reaction conditions by monitoring the ester synthesis. The optimal conditions for formate ester synthesis were found to be: 0.5 M of formic acid, 1.5 M of alcohol, 2% of Novozym 435 at 40 °C and 400 rpm in acetonitrile solvent without molecular sieves. In solvent-free system, the optimal conditions were found to be: 1 M of formic acid, 10 M of alcohol, 2% of Novozym 435 at 40 °C and 400 rpm without molecular sieves. These optimal conditions resulted in maximum ester yield about 90% for 8 h in solvent system and 5 h in solvent-free system. Among all esterification reactions, the esterification reaction of formic acid with octan-1-ol in solvent-free system was the better regarding the quantity of esterified formic acid, catalytic efficiency of lipase and the required reaction time. Under these optimal conditions, the biocatalyst could be reused for six reaction cycles keeping around 97% of its initial activity after treatment process with n-hexane. Consequently, this enzymatic procedure in solvent-free system could provide formate esters for food and cosmetic applications.},

Acetins are among highly rated, value-added products derived from glycerol. The favorable conditions for the enzymatic conversion of glycerol were observed as glycerol to acetic acid molar ratio (1:5), reaction temperature (40 oC) and the amount of enzyme (20% v/v). 65.93% of glycerol conversion was achieved for duration of 15 h with the use of tert-butanol solvent. This method proposes to explore the viability of a biological route to convert glycerol derived from biodiesel industry to acetins with further streamlining.},

Unexpectedly, these $\Delta$Rg0 values strongly deviated from data obtained with classical group contribution methods that are typically used if experimental standard data is not available. In a second step, reaction equilibrium concentrations obtained from esterification catalyzed by Novozym 435 at 323.15 K were measured, and the corresponding activity coefficients of the reacting agents were predicted with perturbed-chain statistical associating fluid theory (PC-SAFT). The so-obtained thermodynamic activities were used to determine $\Delta$Rg0 at 323.15 K. These results could be used to cross-validate $\Delta$Rg0 from experimental formation data. In a third step, reaction-equilibrium experiments showed that equilibrium position of the reactions under consideration depends strongly on the concentration of water and on the ratio of levulinic acid: alcohol in the initial reaction mixtures. The maximum yield of the esters was calculated using $\Delta$Rg0 data from this work and activity coefficients of the reacting agents predicted with PC-SAFT for varying feed composition of the reaction mixtures. The use of the new $\Delta$Rg0 data combined with PC-SAFT allowed good agreement to the measured yields, while predictions based on $\Delta$Rg0 values obtained with group contribution methods showed high deviations to experimental yields.},

abstract = {Free fatty acids (FFA) in low grade oil could be reduced by using an esterification reaction with glycerol, which itself is a waste product of biodiesel synthesis to give mono- and di-glycerides. This study investigated, for the first time, the reaction between oleic acid as a FFA with glycerol, using a phosphonium-based deep eutectic solvent (DES) as a catalyst. The effects of temperature (120 °C, 150 °C and 180 °C) and the DES catalyst concentration (1, 3 and 5 wt%) on the esterification efficiency of fatty acid conversion were observed. The glycerol to fatty acid molar ratio (6:1) and agitation speed (600 rpm) were kept constant. The results revealed that the lowest activation energy of 54.64 kJ/mol was attained using 5 wt% of DES catalyst. Accordingly, optimum reaction conditions were found at a temperature of 150 °C with a 5 wt% DES catalyst, which produced 95% FFA conversion after 30 min of reaction time. In addition, 85% of combined mono- and di-glycerides was observed at the optimum condition, which will be easier to transesterify using alcohol. The process was repeated without adding any fresh catalyst and results showed that catalyst activity sustained very well, suggesting that it can be reused a number of times.},

The effect of ultrasonic conditions such as time and power during the pretreatment as well as the reaction conditions such as substrate molar ratio, reaction time and catalyst loading during the conventional reaction on the yield of tricaprylin has been investigated. It was observed that the optimum pretreatment conditions were irradiation time of 60 min with 240 W supplied power and 60% duty cycle. The optimum reaction conditions were 4:1 molar ratio of caprylic acid to glycerol, catalyst loading as 1% and operating temperature of 170 °C. Three different catalysts as sulphuric acid, hydrochloric acid and para-toluene sulphonic acid (PTSA) have been used to investigate the effect of type of catalyst and also the effect of the presence of adsorbent as silica gel was investigated. The obtained results confirmed that the activity of H2SO4 was higher as compared to HCL and PTSA. It was conclusively established that ultrasound pretreatment based approach greatly influenced the rate of reaction in comparison to the conventional approach and resulted in a green processing approach with maximum tricaprylin yield of 96.6% achieved in 9 h of reaction time compared to 24 h with conventional approach.},

The extraction and quantitative analysis of SG is difficult due to its low problematic concentration and its compatibility with biodiesel. The purpose of this study is to develop a method to quantify SG in FAME and biodiesel using gas chromatography and other equipment found in laboratories performing routine biodiesel analyses. SG was isolated from FAME using n-dodecane, acidification and cold soaking, followed by cold centrifugation at -8 to -15 °C. The solids obtained were further separated by phase partition with a Folch wash, followed by a final n-dodecane rinse. This solution was analyzed by GC-FID using the operating conditions outlined in ASTM D6584. A calibration curve for SG was produced and a first order fit gave a value of r 2 = 0.992. Reproducibility tests were performed on soybean FAME and B100 canola biodiesel samples spiked with SG. The recovery of SG by the new method was found to be 99 % for soy FAME with a standard deviation of 0.7 and 100 % for B100 canola with a standard deviation of 3.5 %. The reproducibility based on two standard deviations of the predicted concentration for all 12 spiked samples studied in this work was 2.4 ppm.},

abstract = {The chemical equilibrium for the preparation of glycerol monostearate (GMS) from glycerol carbonate (GC) and stearic acid (SA) was investigated. The chemical equilibrium constant K of the base-catalyzed synthesis of GMS from GC and SA was much smaller than that of the acid-catalyzed synthesis of (2-oxo-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl) methyl stearate (ODOMS) from GC and SA. In other words, it was thermodynamically difficult to obtain GMS with a high yield from GC and SA catalysed by basic catalysts. To prove this argument, we used magnesium oxide (MgO) as a catalyst to synthesize GMS from GC and SA. As expected, the yield of GMS was quite low. To increase the yield of GMS, a two-step procedure was proposed. First, pure ODOMS was synthesized by the esterification of GC with SA using copper p-toluenesulfonate (CPTS) as the catalyst. The conversion of SA reached 96.14% under the following conditions: reaction temperature, 140 °C; catalyst amount, 3% CPTS (based on the SA weight); reaction time, 3 h; GC-to-SA molar ratio, 1.5:1. Second, GMS was produced at a yield of 64.4% by the hydrolysis of ODOMS in the presence of triethylamine. The syntheses of ODOMS and GMS were confirmed by 1H- and 13C-NMR, FTIR and LC-MS analysis.},

abstract = {It is well recognized that oils with a high 1,3-diacylglycerol content has the advantage of suppressing the accumulation of visceral fat and preventing the increase of body weight, and the synthesis of 1,3-diacylglycerol has attracted considerable attention. It is important to explore various methods for 1,3-diacylglycerol synthesis. In this work, the potential of using lipase Lipozyme TL IM-mediated esterification of oleic acid with glycerol for 1,3-diolein preparation was explored. The effect of solvent, oleic acid feeding strategy, online water removal, water activity, temperature, molar ratio of oleic acid to glycerol and enzyme dosage on the diolein yield and 1,3-positional selectivity of the lipase was investigated systematically. It was found that solvent, water activity, temperature, substrate molar ratio and enzyme dosage had varied influence on diolein yield as well as the positional selectivity of the enzyme. With the increasing water activity and solvent's log P, diolein yield and the positional selectivity increased to a maximum value at a certain point, then had a decrease. It seems that in the process with multiple reaction involved, reactions trend to generate the products with log P closer to the system log P. In addition, with the water activity being closer to its optimum water activity, the hydration degree of the enzyme would be closer to its optimum hydration degree, and the activity might be closer to the highest enzyme activity, causing the reaction proceeding better. Under the optimum conditions (1.8 g Lipozyme TL IM was used to catalyze the reaction with 9.8 g oleic acid and 0.72 g glycerol in the system with 8.4 g toluene, and 6.4 g molecular sieve to remove water), a total diolein yield of about 50% could be achieved with the content of 1,3-diolein in the total diolein over 90%.},

BD production via transesterification with methanol leads to the synthesis of glycerol; this process accounts for 10% (w/w) of the total BD produced worldwide. The increasing demand for environmentally harmless BD has created a glycerol glut, which must be utilized to increase BD profitability. Glycerol is a stable and multifunctional compound used as a building block in fine chemical synthesis. Acetylation and carboxylation pathways have been studied to utilize and/or upgrade glycerol into fine chemicals. The use of catalysts, especially heterogeneous catalysts, remains the green approach for tailoring carboxylation and acetylation routes to achieve the desired products, namely, glycerol carbonate and glycerol acetyl esters, respectively. However, side-product formation, poorly structured channels of some catalysts, and catalyst deactivation or reusability hinder the effective utilization of heterogeneous catalysts and must be further studied. Moreover, introduction of variations to optimize reaction-influencing parameters is a potential green method that must be explored.},

abstract = {The ability of enzymes to operate in organic solvent is now widely accepted and is the basis for extensive research in enzymology. The challenge is to select the solvent media that allows the modulation of enzyme activity. For a rational selection of a solvent, it is necessary to understand the effect of organic solvent molecules on enzyme structure and the enzymatic reaction on a molecular level. To gain such insight, we combined experimental kinetics studies with full atomic molecular dynamics simulations and found a correlation between the activity of Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) [for the esterification reaction between butyric acid and ethanol at a fixed water activity] and the binding of the solvent/substrate molecules in the active site region of CALB. We have investigated the influence of four organic solvents - hexane (HEX), methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), acetonitrile (ACN), and tertiary butanol (TBU) - on the catalytic activity of CALB for the esterification reaction. The solvents have been chosen on the basis of different polarity/functional groups. Our study shows that these organic solvents do not alter the overall conformation of CALB; rather, the solvent effects on the performance of the enzyme may be ascribed to binding of solvent molecules to the enzyme active site region and the solvation energy of substrate molecules in the different solvents. Polar solvent molecules interact strongly with CALB and compete with the substrate to bind to the active site region, resulting in an inhibitory effect which is also confirmed by the binding free energies for the solvent and substrate molecules estimated from the simulations. Consequently, the catalytic activity of CALB decreases in polar solvents. This effect is significant, and CALB is over 10 orders of magnitude more active in nonpolar solvents (HEX and MTBE) than in the polar solvents (ACN and TBU). TBU molecules show an exceptional behavior because the solvent molecule forms an extensive hydrogen bond network within the CALB active site region suggesting that solvent molecules rich on hydrogen bond acceptors and donors are poor solvents when used for lipase-catalyzed esterification reactions.},

abstract = {A kinetic model of the biodiesel production from waste cooking oil using Candida sp. 99-125 lipase as catalyst was established in this paper. The limited reaction steps in the model were considered to be the hydrolysis of glycerides and the esterification of free fatty acids, while the methanolysis of glycerides were considered to be negligible. Matlab programming platform was used to estimate the parameters of the model. A series of experiments were conducted to verify the validity of the model. The results showed that the model could adequately simulate the reaction results of biodiesel production at different lipase loadings, substrate ratios and initial water concentrations. The agreement between experimental data and calculated values was good, which could prove the validity of the kinetic model. Moreover, the results of biodiesel production using a twelve-step methanol feeding method and a three-step methanol feeding method could be simulated well by the kinetic model. The results indicated that the model could also simulate the biodiesel production using methanol step-wise addition. {\textcopyright} 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In this work, the esterification of glycerol with capric acid catalyzed by an immobilized form of a 1,3-positionally selective lipase (Rhizomucor miehei) showed to be effective for the synthesis of 1,3-dicaprin in n-heptane as the reaction medium. The effects of the reaction parameters were studied using an experimental factorial design of three factors and three levels with two central points. The selected experimental variables were amount of glycerol adsorbed on silica gel (G), biocatalyst load (E) and reaction temperature (T), and the response variables were total conversion of capric acid, acylglycerol fractions, selectivity and yield of dicaprin, and acyl migration reaction. The range of each parameter was selected as follows: G = 50-250 mg, E = 20-40 mg and T = 40-60 C. At optimum conditions 73% capric acid conversion was achieved, with 76% dicaprin selectivity, and selectivity to the specific 1,3-dicaprin of 70% of total products. An adequate selection of the reaction conditions is necessary not only to maximize the conversion of capric acid, but also to minimize the acyl migration reaction and the generation of undesired products. Evidence of kinetically controlled enzymatic acyl migration from sn-3/sn-1 to sn-2 is presented. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This study investigated the kinetics of enzymatic neutralization in crude Jatropha oil utilizing an immobilized lipase from Rhizomucor miehei. Free fatty acids, in particular oleic acid were esterified with glycerol. The reaction seems to follow a multisubstrate Ping Pong mechanism with competitive inhibition by the acyl acceptors (mono-, diacylglycerides and glycerol). Free fatty acid content did not affect lipase activity within the ranges investigated. The kinetic parameters were determined and showed that enzyme affinity is much higher to glycerol than to free fatty acids. These observations were supported by the fact that the optimum glycerol level is rather small while the reaction rate increases with increasing free fatty acid concentration. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We have designed a kinetic model of biodiesel production using Novozym 435 (Nz435) with immobilized Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) as a catalyst. The scheme assumed reversibility of all reaction steps and imitated phase effects by introducing various molecular species of water and methanol. The global model was assembled from separate reaction blocks analyzed independently. Computer simulations helped to explore behavior of the reaction system under different conditions. It was found that methanolysis of refined oil by CALB is slow, because triglycerides (T) are the least reactive substrates. Conversion to 95% requires 1.5-6 days of incubation depending on the temperature, enzyme concentration, glycerol inhibition, etc. Other substrates, free fatty acids (F), diglycerides (D) and monoglycerides (M), are utilized much faster (1-2 h). This means that waste oil is a better feedstock for CALB. Residual enzymatic activity in biodiesel of standard quality causes increase of D above its specification level because of the reaction 2M ↔ D + G. Filtration or alkaline treatment of the product prior to storage resolves this problem. The optimal field of Nz435 application appears to be decrease of F, M, D in waste oil before the conventional alkaline conversion. Up to 30-fold reduction of F-content can be achieved in 1-2 h, and the residual enzyme (if any) does not survive the following alkaline treatment. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Background: Pure 1, 3-diacylglycerols (1, 3-DAG) have been considered to be significant surfactants in food, cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries, as well as the effect on obesity prevention. Methods. In this study, a vacuum-driven air bubbling operation mode was developed and evaluated for the enzymatic synthesis of 1, 3-DAG of saturated fatty acids, by direct esterification of glycerol with fatty acids in a solvent-free system. The employed vacuum-driven air bubbling operation mode was comparable to vacuum-driven N{\S}ssub{\S}2{\S}esub{\S} bubbling protocol, in terms of lauric acid conversion and 1, 3-dilaurin content. Results: Some operation parameters were optimized, and 95.3% of lauric acid conversion and 80.3% of 1, 3-dilaurin content was obtained after 3-h reaction at 50°C, with 5 wt% of Lipozyme RM IM (based on reactants) amount. Of the lipases studied, both Lipozyme RM IM and Novozym 435 exhibited good performance in terms of lauric acid conversion. Lipozyme TL IM, however, showed low activity. Lipozyme RM IM showed good operational stability in this operation protocol, 80.2% of the original catalytic activity remained after 10 consecutive batch applications. Some other 1, 3-DAG were prepared and high content was obtained after purification: 98.5% for 1, 3-dicaprylin, 99.2% for 1, 3-dicaprin, 99.1% for 1, 3-dilaurin, 99.5 for 1, 3-dipalmitin and 99.4% for 1, 3-disterin. Conclusion: The established vacuum-driven air bubbling operation protocol had been demonstrated to be a simple-operating, cost-effective, application practical and efficient methodology for 1, 3-DAG preparation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Zhong et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Lipase-catalyzed esterification reactions are among the most significant chemical and biochemical processes of industrial relevance. Lipases catalyze hydrolysis as well as esterification reactions. Enzyme-catalyzed esterification has acquired increasing attention in many applications, due to the significance of the derived products. More specifically, the lipase-catalyzed esterification reactions attracted research interest during the past decade, due to an increased use of organic esters in biotechnology and the chemical industry. Lipases, as hydrolyzing agents are active in environments, which contain a minimum of two distinct phases, where all reactants are partitioned between these phases, although their distribution is not fixed and changes as the reaction proceeds. The kinetics of the lipase-catalyzed reactions is governed by a number of factors. This article presents a thorough and descriptive evaluation of the applied trends and perspectives concerning the enzymatic esterification, mainly for biofuel production; an emphasis is given on essential factors, which affect the lipase-catalyzed esterification reaction. Moreover, the art of using bacterial and/or fungal strains for whole cell biocatalysis purposes, as well as carrying out catalysis by various forms of purified lipases from bacterial and fungal sources is also reviewed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

The activity of the H 3PW 12O 40 catalyst was compared to other Bronsted acid catalysts commonly used in esterification reactions (i.e. p-toluene sulfonic acid and sulfuric acid). The highest glycerol conversions were achieved in H 3PW 12O 40-catalyzed esterification reactions. We demonstrated that unlikely than others homogeneous catalysts, H 3PW 12O 40 may be repeatedly used without loss activity; this way it is also an attractive alternative that may avoid the serious drawbacks of the solid catalysts such as leaching and deactivation. Effects of the HOAc:glycerol molar ratio, acid strength and concentration of the catalysts were also assessed. Additionally, activation energy of the H 3PW 12O 40-catalyzed esterification of glycerol was determined. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The reaction kinetic of the glycerol acetylation with acetic acid catalyzed by sulfuric acid has been studied in the frame of continuous triacetin production. Glycerol, acetic acid and sulfuric acid catalyst were reacted in a batch reactor, in order to get reaction kinetics data. The mole ratio of catalyst to glycerol and temperature were studied during the experience. This study concluded that the selectivity of triacetin increased with increase in mole ratio of catalyst to glycerol. Increasing temperatures lead to increase selectivity of triacetin. It will decreased at the time of acetic acid has begun to evaporate. Triacetin synthesis is an exothermic reaction, a higher reaction temperature will cause in shifting the balance toward formation of reactants.

@article{Felizardo2011,
abstract = {Biodiesel is the main alternative to fossil diesel and it may be produced from different feedstocks such as semi-refined vegetable oils, waste frying oils or animal fats. However, these feedstocks usually contain significant amounts of free fatty acids (FFA) that make them inadequate for the direct base catalyzed transesterification reaction (where the FFA content should be lower than 4%). The present work describes a possible method for the pre-treatment of oils with a high content of FFA (20 to 50%) by esterification with glycerol. In order to reduce the FFA content, the reaction between these FFA and an esterification agent is carried out before the transesterification reaction. The reaction kinetics was studied in terms of its main factors such as temperature, % of glycerin excess, % of catalyst used, stirring velocity and type of catalyst used. The results showed that glycerolysis is a promising pre-treatment to acidic oils or fats (> 20%) as they led to the production of an intermediary material with a low content of FFA that can be used directly in the transesterification reaction for the production of biodiesel. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Lipase B from Candida antarctica (CALB) and lipase from Rhizomucor miehei (RML) were immobilized on Sepabeads (commercial available macroporous acrylic supports) activated with glutaraldehyde (covalent immobilization) or octadecyl groups (adsorption via interfacial activation). All the biocatalysts accumulated diacetin. Covalently immobilized RML was more active towards rac-methyl mandelate than the adsorbed RML. However, this covalent RML preparation presented the lowest activity towards triacetin. For this reason, this preparation was discarded as biocatalyst for this reaction. At pH 7, acyl migration occurred giving a mixture of 1,2 and 1,3 diacetin, but at pH 5.5, only 1,2 diacetin was produced. Yields were improved at acidic pH values and in the presence of 20% acetonitrile (to over 95%). RML immobilized on octadecyl Sepabeads was proposed as optimal preparation, mainly due to its higher specific activity. Each enzyme preparation presented very different properties. Moreover, changes in the reaction conditions affected the various immobilized enzymes in a different way. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

The simulation results show that the overall conformation of CALB is stable in the organic solvents. In the nonpolar solvents, the conformation of the active site keeps stable, whereas in the polar solvents, the solvent molecules reach into the active site and interact intensively with the active site. This interaction destroys the hydrogen bonding between Ser 105 and His224. In the solvents, the activation energy ofCALBand that of the active site region were further simulated by quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulation.

Even though the high cost of the enzyme is still a drawback for the use of this process in industrial scale, the positive aspects of this technology motivate the researches in this field so that better operation conditions and competitiveness of the process are achieved. The Ping Pong Bi-Bi mechanism taking into account the competitive inhibition of the alcohol has been proposed to represent the kinetics of the enzymatic transesterification in many references in the literature, but the kinetic modeling of the enzymatic ethanolysis for the production of biodiesel has not been widely studied. In this work a kinetic modeling of the ethanolysis of sunflower oil catalyzed by lipase Novozym{\textregistered}435 was carried out with kinetic parameters fitted to experimental data retrieved from the literature. The model was successful in predicting the experimental data with the reactor operating in a batch model.

Comparison on the 1,3-specificity was made between reactions driven by low power consecutive microwave irradiation and conventional heating (CH). For the four assayed lipases, the microwave irradiation did not change but weaken the lipase's 1,3-specificity regardless the form of the lipase employed in the solvent-free medium. Novozyme 435 was then selected for the further investigation to reveal the changing of the 1,3-specificity resulted by varying reaction parameters under consecutive microwave irradiation and conventional heating, respectively. The influence of the molar ratio of the substrates, the initial water dosage, the solvents with different log P, and the power of the microwave irradiation on the 1,3-specificity was investigated. In any circumstance assayed, the consecutive microwave irradiation did not change but weaken the 1,3-specificity of Novozyme 435 in the presence or absence of the solvent. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Different immobilized preparations (using octyl-agarose or CNBr agarose) of lipases from Candida rugosa (CRL) and from Alcaligenes sp. (QL) were assayed in the hydrolysis of phthalic acid dibutyl ester and phenylmalonate diethyl ester. The activity of octyl-CRL against di n-butyl phthalate was much higher than that of the enzyme immobilized on BrCN-CRL, while the activity against phthalic acid mono-butyl ester was much lower. Using di n-ethyl phenylmalonate, CRL immobilized on CNBr-agarose exhibited a moderate preference for the diester versus the monoester. A similarly immobilized preparation of QL hydrolyzed in an even faster fashion the monoester than the diester. However, when both enzymes were adsorbed on octyl-agarose, the reaction stopped at the monoester. Moreover, the reaction using this immobilization strategy proceeds much faster than using the other immobilization strategy. Both results suggested that the immobilization of lipases via interfacial activation on hydrophobic supports may can increase the enzyme specificity towards hydrophobic substrates. The lipase QL immobilized on octyl-agarose achieved conversions higher than 99% of and (mono) n-ethyl phenylmalonate, with an ee value of 85% favoring the (+)-isomer. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {This paper reports on an investigation into the impact of carboxylic acid chain length on the kinetics of liquid-phase acid-catalyzed esterification. Using sulfuric acid and a commercial Nafion/silica composite solid acid catalyst (SAC-13), initial kinetics were measured for the reactions of a series of linear chain carboxylic acids (acetic, propionic, butyric, hexanoic, and caprylic acid) with methanol at 60 °C. It was found that reaction rate decreased as the number of carbons in the linear alkyl chain increased for both H2SO4 and SAC-13. This trend is discussed in terms of the polar and steric effects of the alpha-substituent to the carboxylic group and evaluated by a Taft-type correlation. Using a mechanistically based kinetic model, the reaction kinetic parameters of SAC-13 catalysis were determined and compared for different carboxylic acids. Moreover, important parameters, such as water deactivation, catalyst reusability, and regeneration, were also affected by the size of the carboxylic acid used. SAC-13 underwent significantly more activity loss with subsequent reaction cycles as the size of the alkyl tail on the carboxylic acid increased. Characterization of the catalyst after reaction suggested that the deactivation of SAC-13 is likely caused by the entrapment of bulky reaction intermediates in or on Nafion polymeric nanodomains blocking catalytic acid sites. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The esterification kinetics of glycerol with four individual fatty acids (C 12:0, C14:0, C16:0, and C18:0), in the presence of zinc carboxylates (ZnC) of these acids, was investigated. The influence of the ZnC concentration and temperature on the reaction progress was studied. It was found that, under the applied conditions, the process is, with respect to glycerol esterification, a consecutive reaction of first order, with monoacylglycerol (MAG) as an intermediate, stable product. The maximum concentration of MAG in the reaction mixture did not exceed 50%. The reaction conditions as well as the types of carboxylate and fatty acid used influenced the rate of glycerol conversion and MAG formation. Zinc salts of fatty acid were found to be effective in increasing the contact between reactants and, as a consequence, accelerating the reaction progress. The formation of microemulsions in all studied esterification processes was observed. We studied the reaction kinetics in order to prepare emulsifiers with desirable contents of MAG and zinc ions. The influence of the synthesized emulsifiers' composition on their hydrophilic-lipophilic properties was also investigated. The fatty acid chain length as well as the concentration of ZnC influenced the HLB values of the synthesized preparations.},

abstract = {Monoglyceride synthesis by Rhyzomucor miehei lipase was investigated via direct esterification between glycerol (adsorbed onto silica gel) and oleic acid in organic solvents. The main difficulty is to avoid the unwanted production of di- and tri-glycerides. It was demonstrated that an increase in solvent polarity, using mixtures of n-hexane and 2-methyl-2-butanol (2M2B), improves drastically the selectivity toward monoglyceride formation. In pure n-hexane, the monoglyceride represents only 6 molar % of the total products at the thermodynamic equilibrium (34 and 60% for di- and tri-glyceride respectively). Use of an equivolume mixture of n-hexane/2M2B enables a product mixture to be obtained containing 94% of monoglyceride at equilibrium (2.4 and 0% for di- and tri-glyceride respectively). This positive effect is counterbalanced by a decrease both in initial velocities and in substrate conversion at thermodynamic equilibrium. A modeling, able to predict the three thermodynamic equilibria governing the 3 consecutive reactions, based on activity coefficient calculations using the UNIFAC model, is proposed. It takes into account both the partition of water between solvent and immobilized catalyst, and the partition of glycerol between solvent and silica gel. A good correlation with experimental data obtained in n-hexane/2M2B mixtures was observed. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.},

abstract = {The present paper provides a general overview of the factors involved in both the kinetics and the selectivity of partial acylation reactions of polyols (sugars). Different kinetic strategies for maximum production of intermediate esters of various polyols and monosaccharides are reported and discussed. Physicochemical requirements for obtaining maximum selectivities and complementary strategies for reducing reaction times are discussed. The reactions studied include glycerol, glucose, fructose, mannose, sorbitol and an alkyl glucoside as precursors. The high selectivity towards the monoglyceride in the presence and absence of a solvent has been attributed to a combination of the precipitation of the desired ester, use of glycerol in excess and the relatively low solubility of the fatty acid in the system. Unlike the reaction in the presence of a solvent, the reaction in a solvent-free medium produces the diester first. The monoester only accumulates in the medium as a consequence of disproportionation and glycerolysis reactions of the diester formed earlier. Selective esterification of solid sugars (polyols) which have an intermediate solubility in acetone is favored at low temperatures at which a sufficient amount of polyol dissolves and concurrent precipitation of the desired product can be achieved. By contrast, use of elevated temperatures is more appropriate for selective partial esterification of polyols, which are the most soluble in the solvent employed. Polyols (sugars) which are the less soluble into the liquid reaction phase cannot be easily esterified. Diffusional limitations on the rate of dissolution of the solid precursor can be minimized by increasing the surface area of the solid polyol. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {The preparation of monoglycerides can be carried out in the presence of acid or basic catalysts. The use of basic catalysts could limit secondary reactions leading to product degradation. A comparison of solid basic catalysts (MgO, ZnO, Na2CO3) has shown that zinc oxide is one of the best catalysts in the esterification of glycerol with stearic acid (octadecanoic acid) since the usual bases favor soap formation (saponification). Moreover, the use of a well chosen solvent increases the activity and the monoglyceride selectivity of zinc oxide due to the homogenisation of the reaction mixture and the limitation of the thermal reaction. Finally these results show that the esterification rate is strongly dependent on both the catalyst and on the solubility-solvation of reagents and products. {\textcopyright} 2000 Acad{\'{e}}mie des sciences / {\'{E}}ditions scientifiques et m{\'{e}}dicales Elsevier SAS.},
